## Goal
The goal of the green belt is to teach the kids anchor tags and how to create a multi-page website. Each page will need to be styled to look similar. The goal here is to get them to understand the flow of a website.

## Time
The first project usually takes 2 classes, the second project includes videos 2 and 3 combined which usually takes 3 classes.

## Ages/Experience
Target ages: 9+ or 8+ if they have some coding experience.

# Common-problems:
    1) Text for links is outside of <a>
    2) Style.css is not linked in the head of all pages
    3) Want to style each page differently but only know how to use one css file
    4) Navbar looks different on each page
    5) Text should be legible, some students will use bright colors or "matching" colors which makes their text hard to read
    6) Spaces in file names
